# Zai

Zai is a small programming language which I wrote for fun. The language:

- Is Dynamically typed
- Is Entirely written in Python
- Supports classes
- Supports first-class functions
- Supports writing and importing modules
# Examples
Coming Soon...
# Missing Features
Here is a list of the features which are currently missing but will be implemented in the future
- Basic class inheritance
- Prefix/Postfix increment and decrement operators
- Importing and calling native python functions(Maybe...)
# Internals and Documentation
- The language grammar can be found within the [docs/grammar file](docs/grammar)
- Some more in-depth details about the implementation(how objects are represented internally, environment...) can be found within [docs/architecture.md file](docs/architecture.md)
