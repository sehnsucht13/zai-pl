# Zai

Zai is a small programming language which I wrote for fun. The language:

- Is Dynamically typed
- Is Entirely written in Python
- Supports classes
- Supports first-class functions
- Supports writing and importing modules

**NOTE:** This is a project made for both learning and fun. It is not meant to be used in serious projects.
# Examples
Coming Soon...

# Missing Features and Future Improvements
Here is a list of the features which are currently missing but will be implemented in the future
- [ ] Basic class inheritance
- [ ] Floating Point Numbers
- [ ] Prefix/Postfix increment and decrement operators
- [ ] Better test suite
- [ ] Importing and calling native python functions(Maybe...)

# Internals and Documentation
- The language grammar can be found within the [docs/grammar file](https://github.com/sehnsucht13/zai-pl/blob/master/docs/grammar)
- Some more in-depth details about the implementation(how objects are represented internally, environment...) can be found within [docs/architecture.md file](https://github.com/sehnsucht13/zai-pl/blob/master/docs/architecture.md)
